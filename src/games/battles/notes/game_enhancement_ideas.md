# Game Enhancement Ideas

## 1. Skill Combination System
- Certain skills can form special combinations
- For example, selecting both "Attack Boost" and "Combo" triggers additional effects
- This encourages players to try different skill combinations
- Increases the game's exploratory nature

## 2. Dynamic Point System
- Base points change each round
- For example, more points in odd rounds, fewer in even rounds
- Forces players to adopt different strategies in different rounds
- Increases game variability

## 3. Skill Chain System
- Using certain skills enhances the effects of other specific skills
- For example, using "Healing Potion" increases the effect of "Attack Boost" in the next round
- Increases the relationship between skills
- Requires deeper thinking about skill usage order

## 4. Environmental Effect System
- Special environmental effects appear randomly every few rounds
- For example, "Critical Round": all attack damage is doubled
- Or "Recovery Round": all healing skills are enhanced
- Increases game variability
- Forces players to adjust strategies based on the environment

## 5. Skill Evolution System
- Certain skills evolve after being used a certain number of times
- For example, "Healing Potion" becomes "Super Healing Potion" after 3 uses
- Encourages players to reuse certain skills
- Increases the game's growth aspect

## 6. Skill Counter System
- Certain skills can counter opponent's skills
- For example, "Magic Shield" can negate opponent's "Attack Boost"
- Increases interaction between skills
- Makes the game more strategic

## 7. Point Loan System
- Players can borrow future points
- But need to pay interest
- Increases resource management strategy
- Forces players to weigh short-term and long-term benefits

## 8. Skill Sharing System
- Certain skills can be shared with opponents
- But effects change after sharing
- Increases interaction between players
- Makes the game more interesting

These schemes can be used individually or in combination to enhance the game's fun and strategic depth.
